"""
# Coordinator/Dispatcher Pattern
Structure: A central LlmAgent (Coordinator) manages several specialized sub_agents.
Goal: Route incoming requests to the appropriate specialist agent.
ADK Primitives Used:
Hierarchy: Coordinator has specialists listed in sub_agents.
Interaction: Primarily uses LLM-Driven Delegation 
(requires clear descriptions on sub-agents and appropriate instruction on Coordinator) 
or Explicit Invocation (AgentTool) (Coordinator includes AgentTool-wrapped specialists in its tools).

# User asks "My payment failed" -> Coordinator's LLM should call transfer_to_agent(agent_name='Billing')
# User asks "I can't log in" -> Coordinator's LLM should call transfer_to_agent(agent_name='Support')
